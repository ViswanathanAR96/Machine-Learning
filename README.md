# Machine-Learning
Collection of commonly used machine learning algorithms in python

1) K- Nearest Neighbours.
K-Nearest Neighbour algoithm is a simple supervised learning algorithm. Find the 'k' nearest points to the test data, predict the class based on majority vote.
Hyper Parameters : 
  (a) k - Choose k nearest points to make the classification. 
  (b) distance - There are several distance metrics one could choose to calculate the distance between train datapoint and test datapoint. Used manhattan, mikowski and eulidiean distances as the metrics.
  (c) Weights - Weighted K-nn performs better than K-nn because of the factor of adding less weights to outliers and more weights to nearby datapoints.
 Combination of K-Means to draw clusters and K-NN to classify the datapoints works well too.
