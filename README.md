# Machine-Learning
Collection of commonly used machine learning algorithms in python

## 1) K- Nearest Neighbours.
K-Nearest Neighbour algoithm is a simple supervised learning algorithm. Find the 'k' nearest points to the test data, predict the class based on majority vote.
Hyper Parameters : 
  (1) k - Choose k nearest points to make the classification. 
  (2) distance - There are several distance metrics one could choose to calculate the distance between train datapoint and test datapoint. Used manhattan, mikowski and eulidiean distances as the metrics.
  (3) Weights - Weighted K-nn performs better than K-nn because of the factor of adding less weights to outliers and more weights to nearby datapoints.
 Combination of K-Means to draw clusters and K-NN to classify the datapoints works well too.

## 2) Statistical Parameters
  A file that contains popular statistical parameters commonly used for Machie Learning. Given a dataset, following parameters could be computed :
  1) mean
  2) median
  3) mode
  4) vairance
  5) MAD
  6) skew
  7) entropy
  8) sharpness
  9) IQR
